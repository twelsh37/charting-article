# Creating Stunning Visualisations with Plotly: A Beginner's Guide to Plotly Express Charts
## Supporting files for my Medium articles on the above heading

This repository contains the supporting files for my Medium series of articles.<br>
The code in the articles is quite simple and is designed to show how easy it is to create stunning visualisations with Plotly Express. the files here are broken into functions along with docstrings and error handling.<p>

 I decided to write several articles on Plotly Express charting to show the power of Plotly Express and how easy it is to create stunning visualisations with it.<p>
 Where possible I have cited the dataset that I used in the article. <p>
The code here in this repo is augmented from the simpler code that is used in the articles. This code is split into functions and has rudimentary error handling<p> 
Docstrings were created by AI<p>
